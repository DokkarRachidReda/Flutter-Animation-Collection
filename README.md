# Flutter Animation Collection

A collection of animations that i have made using flutter :)

## Getting Started
inside the `lib` folder you will find some dart files, you can copy the file content to see the animation, there are now 4 files with the main file.

each file can be a root widget for the app (i made it in the main file then i just copied it to another file), most likly the animation will be applied in the first page of the app, so it would be easier for you to use it.
